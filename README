MiniSat-ocaml
=============

MiniSat-ocaml is a set of OCaml bindings for the SAT solver MiniSat.  Instead
of reimplementing MiniSat itself in OCaml, this library makes the MiniSat
interface available through OCaml.

The usage of the OCaml interface is pretty straightforward and mimics the C++
interface.

The package provides an example, solver.ml, that reads from standard input a
formula and print its satisfiability and a satisfying assignment (if any). A
formula is a sequence of lines that either define a variable ('v' <name>),
define a clause ('c' followed by a sequence of names, with a leading '-' if
they are negated in the clause) and comments (starting with '#'). A couple of
example formulas are available in the 'examples/' directory.

Install and use
===============

To compile MiniSat-ocaml you need the minisat solver (compiled as a dynamic
library) installed on the system. On debian, the package minisat2 contains both
the dynamic library and headers. Recently the minisat2 package in debian unstable
has few problems. See #606846 and #606643 on the debian bts for details. Until 
these problems are fixed these bindings will not compile on debian.

$ aptitude install minisat2
$ make

To test it :
$./solver.byte examples/1.formula
